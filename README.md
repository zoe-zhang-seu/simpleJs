## Target

- review javascript concept: Usually we use typescript, react.  Use this chance to review some basic usage of javascript and html. mainly 
- build dockerfile for app and server
- quickly try concepts mentioned in `html5 programming with javascript for dummies`.

TODO: 
- The package.json should better move out of server. But when i change `COPY ../package*.json ./` then it has error. should be path error.
